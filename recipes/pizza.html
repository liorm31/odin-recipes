          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Dough</li>
              <li>Sauce</li>
              <li>Cheese</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl.<br>
                 Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
              <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
              <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
              <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
              <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
              <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
              <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
              <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
